# password-generator-attempt2

## Description
I was motivated to correct the mistakes I had previously made in the first attempt of this challenge, and really get the hang of javascript to understand front-end functionality. I wanted to hone my skills in javascript with this challenge. This app will randomly generate a secure password with the variables the user requests. I learned many factors of prompts, alerts, and the input that goes into them.
